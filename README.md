# Unofficial-Version-of-CChatGUIDStatsLogger-version-3.0.2.2

This is the unofficial version of the "CChatGUIDStatsLogger-version-3.0.2.2" plugin for the game server managing program Procon.  XpKiller wrote the original official plugin version.  My modification is only a tiny easy change in comparison to all of his very hard work.

Changes from the official version:
Line 2992:  fixed null primary key issue which causes issues with MySQL version 5.7.3 m13 and up.
